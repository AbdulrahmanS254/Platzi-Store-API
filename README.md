# MyStore - Simple E-commerce Front-End üõçÔ∏è

This repository contains the front-end code for MyStore, a simple and modern e-commerce interface. It's built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on fetching and displaying product data from a public API. This project demonstrates dynamic content rendering, client-side filtering, and pagination.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Product Catalog:** Displays a grid of products fetched from an external API.
* **Product Detail Page:** Click on any product to see a dedicated page with more details.
* **Category & Price Filtering:** A sidebar allows users to filter products by category and a specified price range.
* **Pagination:** Easily navigate through multiple pages of products.
* **Dynamic Routing:** Uses URL query parameters (`?id=...`) to link from the product list to the correct detail page.

## Technologies Used

This project was built from scratch using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with Custom Properties for theming, Flexbox, and Grid)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+ for API calls with `fetch`)

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can do this by double-clicking the file or using a live server extension in your code editor (like Live Server for VS Code).

## API Used

This project uses the free **[Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/)** for all product and category data. A big thank you to them for providing this excellent resource for developers.
